This repository contains `sdkSeedProviders.json`, a resource for [Lava Access SDK]([https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk](https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk)) to discover the first providers to connect to access initial Pairing data. 

Inspired by common Seed nodes solutions (like Ethereum’s [Bootnodes]([https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/bootnodes.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/bootnodes.go))), the Lava network uses the json to offer a decentralized solution for connecting new consumers to the network through provider nodes, enabling accurate data and reliability.

With “Lava Over Lava”, the SDK is able to provide a robust and accountable connection to the network, taking the best of seed nodes and applying it to the unique Lava ecosystem. 

Currently:
geolocation 1 == North America 
geolocation 2 == Europe
